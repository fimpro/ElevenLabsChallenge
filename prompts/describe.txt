I have found this place on google maps:
{google_description}

Tell something nice about this place to a tourist who has never seen it before. Tell it in an enjoyable way: include some fun facts and useful information, while not providing too much boring information like dates which no one will ever remember.
Only provide the description, so don't for example write 'Sure, here is the description: ...'. Instead, write it immediately. Also, make sure to write it in English, even if the place has some parts written in a different language.
